## Motivation:
 You may have the same problem I do. You keep buying books and your friends, coworkes, or just random people on the internet are recommending all these books for you to read. I want to help people keep track of what books they're reading. If you are reading mulitple books at once its good to have a place where you can store what page you are on, how you felt at the time, and keep track of what books are in your ever expanding wishlist of books to read. I've built BookMarker to help you out.
